# Image-classification-using-CNN

## Overview
This project is focused on developing advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to tackle complex image recognition tasks. The core of this repository is the Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the architecture, training, and evaluation of CNN models using Python and Keras.

## Project Structure
- `convolutional_neural_network.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing detailed code, explanations, and visualization of the CNN models.

## Prerequisites
To run the notebooks, you will need to have the following libraries installed:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Keras
- TensorFlow

You can install these packages via pip:

pip install numpy matplotlib keras tensorflow

Model Description
The CNNs in this project are designed to handle various image processing tasks, from basic object recognition to more complex scenarios like pattern recognition in varying conditions. The models utilize layers such as convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to learn from image data.

Results
Our CNN models are evaluated based on their accuracy and efficiency in processing and classifying new images. The results section includes graphs and tables that display the performance metrics.
